1. Used grep -r facility to find the facility
2. ⁠used rm and rmdir to delete the facility
3. ⁠then used grep -r wormhole and found the wormhole.sh, executed it using sh command
4. ⁠used git checkout GargantuaSystem to switch to gargantua system
5. ⁠used grep -r -a ”==“ to find the final part of the base 64 code (ik it was not supposed to be done that way T_T)
6. created a solve.sh script to decode base 64 and executed it
7. ⁠used grep -r habitable and ended up finding the gravity_singularity.sh
8. ⁠executed it and used the password found after decoding the base64 and voila
